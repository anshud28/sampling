| Feature                          | Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (Cycle 33) | Canadian Election Study Online Survey, 2019 | Trophic Niche Flexibility in *Glossophaga soricina*: how a nectar seeker sneaks an insect snack |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sample type**                  | Stratified random sampling, accounting for geographic and demographic characteristics.     | Non-probability online survey; RDD internet survey | Observational, capturing individuals in natural habitats (Costa Rica) and behavioral testing in controlled lab settings. |
| **Sample size**                  | 27,229 respondents.                                                                        | CPS: 37,822; PES: 10,337 (Online); RDD: CPS = 4,021, PES = 2,889 | 75 individuals sampled, but ~22% showed insectivory in fecal analysis. |
| **Target population**            | Canadians aged 15 years and older, excluding residents of the territories and full-time military members. | Canadian residents eligible to vote, focus on constituency-level analysis and underrepresented groups | *Glossophaga soricina* (nectarivorous bats) in Costa Rica. |
| **Sampling frame**               | Canadian households listed in the Census.                                                  | Online platform for large samples; RDD survey smaller | Bats captured during a 7-week period in Area de ConservaciÃ³n Guanacaste. |
| **Survey mode(s)**               | Telephone and online surveys.                                                              | Online survey; Random digit dialing internet survey | Field surveys, molecular analysis (DNA barcoding), behavioral observations. |
| **Timeline**                     | September 2018 to December 2018.                                                           | Two waves: Campaign period (CPS) and post-election (PES). | May to July 2009 for field collection; lab analysis completed by 2013. |
| **Response rate**                | Approximately 47%.                                                                         | Not explicitly provided. | Not applicable (observational). |
| **Weights**                      | Applied to ensure population-level representativeness.                                     | Likely applied, though specific details not provided. | Not applicable. |
| **Data processing**              | Cleaned for duplicates; imputation for missing data; weighting for demographic balance.    | Core questions replicated from previous CES studies; community projects imbedded. | DNA analysis of fecal matter; excluded ambiguous dietary samples. |
| **Cleaning, imputation, etc.**   | Standard imputation applied for missing demographic or response data.                      | Not explicitly stated; likely part of CES protocol. | Exclusion of incomplete dietary data and ambiguous DNA sequences. |
| **Sources of error**             | Non-response bias, potential recall bias, sampling frame exclusions.                       | Non-response bias; underrepresentation of offline populations. | Limited reference database for insect DNA; small sample size may restrict generalizability. |
| **Limitations, known biases**    | Underrepresentation of rural or internet-limited populations; potential social desirability bias. | Non-probability sampling and online platform biases; RDD smaller with fewer questions. | Geographic specificity and capture bias (not all individuals excreted usable fecal samples). |
