# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?


    The sample quality is fairly strong due to the use of a stratified random sampling method, which helps capture representation across departments with high turnover, mitigating potential undercoverage bias. However, nonresponse bias could still affect representativeness, as dissatisfied employees who left may choose not to participate. Additionally, recall bias might influence responses from former employees reflecting on their past experiences. While stratification enhances coverage, the accuracy and completeness of the sampling frame, such as having up-to-date contact details for former employees, remain crucial for robust results.
    

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

Updated Survey:

How satisfied were you with your role at the company before considering leaving? (Scale: 1â€“5) Unchanged as it remains clear and concise.

Which of the following factors influenced your decision to leave or think about leaving? (Choose all that apply: Pay, Career growth, Work-life balance, Relationship with management, Company culture, Job satisfaction, Otherâ€”please specify) Added "please specify" to "Other" for better measurement completeness.

How well did you feel supported by your manager in achieving your professional goals? (Options: Very supported, Somewhat supported, Neutral, Somewhat unsupported, Very unsupported) Unchanged as it provides actionable insights.

How effective was the companyâ€™s communication and transparency on important issues? (Options: Very effective, Somewhat effective, Neutral, Somewhat ineffective, Very ineffective) Unchanged as it directly addresses key organizational factors.

Did you feel there was a clear path for career advancement within the company? (Options: Yes, Somewhat, No) Unchanged for simplicity and relevance.

How often did you feel stressed or overloaded by your workload? (Options: Always, Often, Sometimes, Rarely, Never) Revised wording to ensure neutrality: "How often did you feel your workload was manageable?"

What changes do you think the company could make to improve job satisfaction and reduce turnover? Added an instruction: "Be as specific as possible for actionable feedback."

Would you recommend the company to others as a good place to work? (Options: Yes, No, Not sure) Revised options: Yes, No, Maybeâ€”to reduce forced-choice bias.

9.How satisfied were you with the companyâ€™s benefits and compensation? (Scale: 1â€“5) Unchanged.



3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

No, an observational study would not have effectively served the purpose of the survey. Observational methods are inadequate for understanding employee intentions, motivations, and subjective experiencesâ€”critical factors in addressing turnover. Surveys are necessary to gather qualitative insights, such as the underlying causes of dissatisfaction or suggestions for improvement, which cannot be deduced solely from observational data.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
